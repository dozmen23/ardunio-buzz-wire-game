Touching the wire triggers **a buzzer and LED alert**, and the system tracks **errors, score, and time**.

## Features
- Capacitive touch sensors for start/end detection
- Checkpoint and bonus scoring system
- Real-time LCD display
- Error tracking with LED and buzzer feedback

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- TTP223 Touch Sensors (x2)
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Active Buzzer
- Red LED
- Push buttons
- Metallic loop & wand

## How to Play
1. Touch the start sensor to begin.
